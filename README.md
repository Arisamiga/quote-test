This website is a website made for studying quotes, either from a premade library of quotes, or from your own. This website was originally made to study Shakespeare quotes in our english class.
<br>
<br>


## How to use
To start a quote test, you can either type in your own quotes or use the premade quotes we made. <br>
<br>
The quote test is started by pressing `Start Quote Test`. <br>
Once the quote test has started, fill out the missing words and then press `Submit Quote Test`. <br>
*(For added challenge, the intensity of words removed from each quote can be changed in the options menu.)*<br>
